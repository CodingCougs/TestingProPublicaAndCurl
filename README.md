# TestingProPublicaAndCurl

This is a simple C++ program to pull data from the ProPublica API. Mostly used as an example for future use cases and testing.

You'll need to get your own API Key to use the API, which can be done at the ProPublica website (https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api). There is plenty of API documentation on their website with all of the URIs needed to pull information there.

Example code used to create this program was found at https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/https.html
